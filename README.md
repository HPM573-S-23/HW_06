# Homework Assignment 6


**Overview**. In the urgent care simulation model we developed in class, let's assume that 
patients will also get screened for depression during their exam. If the result is positive, they will be 
seen by an on-site mental health specialist before leaving the urgent care. 
Here we want to make the necessary changes to the model we implemented in the class
to simulate the operation of this new system.

**Problem 1: Flowcharts (Weight 4)**. 


**Problem 2: Simulation (Weight 10)**. 

Run your simulation with these assumptions:
- 20 hours of operation
- 10 exam rooms,
- 1 mental health specialist on site,
- Patient inter-arrival time exponentially distributed with mean 1 minutes, 
- Exam duration exponentially distributed with mean 10 minutes,
- Proportion of patients screened positive for depression 10%, 
- Duration of mental health consultation exponentially distributed with mean 20 minutes.

Report:
- Average patient time in system,
- Average patient waiting time,
- Average patient waiting time to see the mental health specialist
- Sample paths of: 
    - Patients in the system
    - Patients waiting to see the mental health specialist
    - Utilization of mental health specialist
